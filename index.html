      <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
      <h2>Website: <br> Thai Food Connection Ordering Screen</h2>

      <p>Website are always created almost everyday with new ideas being developed by those who want to share their ideas 
        or want to provide a service. However, there are websites that have been neglected or not updated after a while. This
        page will explore and redesign the website below. I choose this website, because when I first saw this page, I did not
        like it nor find it memorable, and thought it was not up to par with the other ordering pages that I have seen before. In hopes of changing this, 
        I aim to redesign this page and address some issues that I can see.

     <h3>Learnability</h3>

            Simple page, not much to remember. Does its task and nothing else

          <li>
            Important information is small and does not make it seem important

      <h2>Accessibility</h2>


        <p>
          Running this website through the Waive service resulted in 184 errors and 157 alerts.
          <br>
          Most of these issues were related to accessibility, such as alternative text, as well as some functional issues.
          I agreed with the results as I was not surprised there were a lot of missing alternative text and empty form labels.
          Additionally, the service pointed out useless buttons and redundacies that I had initally seen in the problems section above, leading
          the conculusions I made about usability and memorability being lacking.

      <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
            <div id="ogwebsite">

          <p>
            By creating a style guide we can establish the main colors, typography, and components in different states. This
            allows us to ensure that the interactions are consistent throughout our redesign in order to keep the user's experience coherent,
            in addition to allowing us exploration with colors and design choices.

      <h4>Low and High Fidelity Prototyping:</h4>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
          <div id="description">
              <h5>Phone:</h5>
              <div id="prototyping">
                <img class="lofi" src="./assets/lofiphone.png">
                <img class="hifi" src="./assets/hifiphone.png">
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  For the phone interface, I wanted the important information such as hours, address, and phone number to remain apparent and easy to see and find.
                  I also wanted to provide a bit more guidance on how to use the webpage, by placing most of the required options in the same location. Additionally, I
                  wanted an emphasis on the food and their categories with the smaller screen size, therefore allowing that to take the most space on the screen, and allowing to checkout panel be at 
                  the bottom of the screen when used on a phone.
                </p>
              </div>
          </div>

          <div id="description">
            <h5>Tablet:</h5>
              <div id="prototyping">
                <img class="lofi" src="./assets/lofitab.png">
                <img class="hifi" src="./assets/hificomp.png">
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  For the tablet interface, because we have more room, I shrunk and moved the food panel over, and decided to place the checkout menu container on the left. This would stay on the right of the screen while you scroll through the page.
                  Other than the resizing the layout is similar to the iphone, with things moving around as more space become avaliable or unavailable.
                </p>
              </div>
          </div>

          <div id="description">
            <h5>Laptop:</h5>
              <div id="prototyping">
                <img class="lofi" src="./assets/loficomp.png">
                <img class="hifi" src="./assets/hifitab.png">
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  For the laptop interface, because we have even more room, I placed a sticking container of links to areas of the page that would be hidden by the dimensions of the interface on the left of the screen.
                  This would stay of the left of the screen while you scroll through the page so you always have access to it.
                  Other than the resizing the layout is similar to the tablet, with things moving around as more space become avaliable or unavailable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is the redesigned page of the original website at the top of this page. It is responsive such that it fits and designed differently on a phone, tablet, and laptop.
                  Some of the features were added throughout the process, it addition to different formating and sizing as this page was being designed. However, the overall concepts and schema of 
                  the prototype are reflected in this design.
